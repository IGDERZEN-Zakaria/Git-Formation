<p>Regarding reconciliation of scientific and religious thinking, I’d add that the atheists or materialists only acknowledge the existence of matter and energy but it can be demonstrated that the universe is not simply matter and energy. It also includes information, concepts and consciousness and these are all interrelated. The arrangement of physical objects (matter) and the transfer of energy (light, electromagnetic energy or sound) can be modulated in ways that convey meaning beyond merely the physical properties of matter and energy. Ask yourself, “where are numbers located?” They are not the energetic firings of your neurons. They are concepts that require consciousness. All acts of consciousness are exercises of our spirit. Spiritually is what can be described as “religious thought”.</p>
